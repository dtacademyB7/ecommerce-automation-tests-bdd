Build a Cucumber BDD framework:
1. Add dependencies (selenium, webdrivermanager, cucumber-java, cucumber-junit, cucumber-core)
2. Add .gitignore
3. Create packages, add utilities, properties file
4.


     Cucumber framework components
     - feature files
     - Step Definition classes
     - Runner class
     - the scenario steps in feature files are connected to the corresponding
       step definition methods in step def classes thru Runner class's @CucumberOptions options:
          features = "src/test/resources",
          glue = "stepDefinitions"
     - the scenario step is matched to the corresponding step definition method through the text of the scenario step and step definition
           For example:
               step -> Given I am on the homepage
               step def method annotation -> @Given("I am on the homepage")



    Basic workflow of a Cucumber framework

     - create a feature file
     - add scenario/s to a feature file
     - generate snippet/s for unimplemented steps
     - implement the each step def method logic


    Cucumber Hooks:
    - methods with @Before and @After annotations that are added under step defs folder
    - used to setup  and teardown
